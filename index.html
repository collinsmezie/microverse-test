            <h3>Timeline-How Far AI Has Come.</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>1943</strong> - Born out of the desire to create increasingly capable systems</li>
          <li><strong>1956</strong>- The term Artificial Intelligence is coined and recognized.</li>
          <li><strong>1974-1980</strong> - AI experiences a major drawback due to it's inherent shortcomings at the time which consequently led to lack of proper funding in it's research and development,this time period became known as the first AI winter.</li>
           <li><strong>1981</strong>- large scale revival of interest in AI due to the  developments of  artificial neural networks which became a huge milestone for AI at the time.</li>
            <li><strong>1988</strong>- AI experiences a second winter as it fails to produce effective results as expected.</li> <li><strong>2010 Till date</strong>- An explosion in revolutionary computing power and masssive data collection brings AI into the spot light again, and since then artificial intellience has been improving dramatically with less error rates.
              
        <p> Artificial Intelligence has come really far, from surviving several major challenges to becoming the world leading technological solution in several aspects of human endeavour from education to healthcare.AI indeed is here to stay and will power our world well into the future just the way electricity did.</p>
